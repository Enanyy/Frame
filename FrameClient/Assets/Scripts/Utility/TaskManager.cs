/// This is a new coroutine interface for Unity.
///
/// The motivation for this is twofold:
///
/// 1. The existing coroutine API provides no means of stopping specific
///    coroutines; StopCoroutine only takes a string argument, and it stops
///    all coroutines started with that same string; there is no way to stop
///    coroutines which were started directly from an enumerator.  This is
///    not robust enough and is also probably pretty inefficient.
///
/// 2. StartCoroutine and friends are MonoBehaviour methods.  This means
///    that in order to start a coroutine, a user typically must have some
///    component reference handy.  There are legitimate cases where such a
///    constraint is inconvenient.  This implementation hides that
///    constraint from the user.
///
/// Example usage:
///
/// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
/// IEnumerator MyAwesomeTask()
/// {
///     while(true) {
///         Debug.Log("Logcat iz in ur consolez, spammin u wif messagez.");
///         yield return null;
////    }
/// }
///
/// IEnumerator TaskKiller(float delay, Task t)
/// {
///     yield return new WaitForSeconds(delay);
///     t.Stop();
/// }
///
/// void SomeCodeThatCouldBeAnywhereInTheUniverse()
/// {
///     Task spam = new Task(MyAwesomeTask());
///     new Task(TaskKiller(5, spam));
/// }
/// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
///
/// When SomeCodeThatCouldBeAnywhereInTheUniverse is called, the debug console
/// will be spammed with annoying messages for 5 seconds.
///
/// Simple, really.  There is no need to initialize or even refer to TaskManager.
/// When the first Task is created in an application, a "TaskManager" GameObject
/// will automatically be added to the scene root with the TaskManager component
/// attached.  This component will be responsible for dispatching all coroutines
/// behind the scenes.
///
/// Task also provides an event that is triggered when the coroutine exits.
